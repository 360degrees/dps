DPS - Distributed Pub/Sub
=========================

Simple and plain stupid pub/sub messaging, with full duplication across several
nodes.

TODO:
=====

* Replace lists with a priority queue implementation
* Add tests (ideally - integration tests)
* Add more robust nodes discovering
* Add docs and specs
* Add channels closing support
* Compare to replicated redis pub/sub
